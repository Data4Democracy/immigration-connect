## Projects

Project leads have a weekly meeting with the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) and will share updates from those meetings and update projects based on the needs of the NILC. All active and completed projects can be found below and you can also browse our current [help wanted issues](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/immigration-connect/issues) for more information.

We are also very open to connecting with any other organizations whose work focuses on immigration issues, please contact any of the project leads if you feel we could support your work:

* **"First-timers" are welcome!** Whether you're trying to learn data science, hone your coding skills, or get started collaborating over the web, we're happy to help. *(Sidenote: with respect to Git and GitHub specifically, our [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground) repo and the [#github-help](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/github-help/) Slack channel are good places to start.)*
* **We believe good code is reviewed code.** All commits to this repository are approved by project maintainers and/or leads (listed above). The goal here is *not* to criticize or judge your abilities! Rather, sharing insights and achievements. Code reviews help us continually refine the project's scope and direction, as well as encourage the discussion we need for it to thrive.
* **This README belongs to everyone.** If we've missed some crucial information or left anything unclear, edit this document and submit a pull request. We welcome the feedback! Up-to-date documentation is critical to what we do, and changes like this are a great way to make your first contribution to the project.
* **Get involved!** Browse our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/immigration-connect/issues). All of our current discussions, proposals, and active projects are kept there and it will be the fastest way to determine how you can jump in and start helping.
