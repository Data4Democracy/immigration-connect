# immigration-connect

## Overview

We collect, analyze, and model data related to immigration-related issues. We are also building tools (visualizations, email parsers, matching algorithms to connect to connect pro bono lawyers with immigrants in need) to support the work of organizations working on immigration law and related issues.

## Projects

Most of our projects have been a result of our partnership with the [National Immigration Law Center (NILC)](https://www.nilc.org/). Project leads have a weekly(ish) meeting with the NILC and will update projects on their behalf.

Check our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/immigration-connect/issues) for more information on active projects and tasks.

We are also very open to connecting with other organizations as well! If you feel we could support your work, contact our Partnerships Leads listed above.
