# immigration-connect

## Project Description

Collecting, analyzing, and modeling data related to immigration. We're also building tools (visualizations, email parsers, matching algorithms to connect to connect pro bono lawyers with immigrants in need) to support the work of organizations working on immigration law and other immigration related issues.

## Projects

Project leads have a weekly meeting with the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) and will share updates from those meetings and update projects based on the needs of the NILC.
