# UCIS-processing-time

## Purpose
To create an interactive data visualization about USCIS Processing time to create awareness among targeted audiences and policymakers and to use as evidence in favor of policy changes.

## Background
In a recent report, in their Policy Brief, AILA (American Immigration Lawyers Association) reported that USCIS Processing Delays Have Reached Crisis Levels Under the Trump Administration. Similarly, NBCNews reported Citizenship application backlog 'skyrocketed'. We need a system for faster matching of desired workers with companies, quicker integration of immigrants in American political life and culture, citizenship unlocks a number of personal rights (personal security, family reunification, etc.).

## Projects

The data-viz product should demonstrate the processing time by:
* form or filing category (e.g. N-400 | Applying for U.S. Citizenship) and
* field or Service center (e.g. New York)
in an interactive map that was superimposed into U.S. Congressional maps with time series data.
* There is no API for the USCIS site so it is manual data scraping.
* Any interactive plots with time series data would work such as but not limited to Shiny in R or D3
* Processing data for Forms I-90, I-485, I-751, and N-400 is reported as an interval of 2 numbers as part of a pilot project. The first number is the time it takes to complete 50% of cases (the median). The second number is the time it takes to complete 93% of cases. For non-pilot forms, USCIS uses the old method to calculate processing times but will add an upper limit that is generally 130% of the processing time.
