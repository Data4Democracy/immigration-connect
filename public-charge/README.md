# Public Charge Project

## Project Overview

The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) would like help collecting and storing data from a regulation.gov page for a proposed “Public Charge” rule which targets immigrants who may depend on government benefits.

We want to collect
1) Primary Documents;
2) Supporting Documents; and
3) Comments
and automatically store them in a database.
