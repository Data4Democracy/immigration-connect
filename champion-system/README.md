# Champion System

## Project Goal

Augement and automate the process the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) uses to connect
affected individuals in need of immigration related legal advice/assistance to the appropriate
resources and assist the NILC with the collection of the stories of those they help.

See the [conceptual system diagram](elected-hotline.pdf) provided by the NILC for more details.

## Core Components

TBD, see [technical requirements](TECHNICAL.md) doc for future plans.

## Project Description

### Motivation

The idea for this project arose immediately after the signing of the executive order banning
entry into the United States for 90 days by citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia,
Sudan, and Yemen. The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) was one of the first organizations
to bring litigation against the current administration contesting the legality of this ban,
but they also offered their services to any immigrants in need of legal assistance in entering
the country during the uncertain few days of the ban. In addition to the in-house services the
NILC already had at their disposal, however, hundreds of professionally practicing lawyers 
contacted the NILC with offers of pro-bono legal advice to any individuals who needed it. The
massive influx of both volunteers and individuals in need of assistance was overwhelming and
made clear the need for a more automated system of intake and connection. Currently, the NILC
does client assessment and intake manually. Volunteer intake and connection is also done 
manually. 

The name for this project, Champion System, arises from the idea that the system will allow
those referring individuals to the NILC for assistance *and* the volunteers who wish to offer
their services to become champions for those affected individuals. One of the primary sources
of client referrals to the NILC are congressional representatives and their staff. The NILC
and D4D would like to empower those individuals to easily and quickly refer clients and be 
confident that their referrals will get reviewed in a timely manner. Additionally, the system
will be designed in a way that affected individuals will be able to self-refer, a requirement
that became clear after the influx of clients during the travel ban, in a simple manner that
will ensure they receive an appropriate response. Volunteer lawyers will also be able to become
champions for those in need by being able to be automatically connected to, or easily browse,
cases their expertise would allow them to assist with most effectively. Finally, the NILC comms
team will be able to collect the stories of the individuals they help in a centralized way in
order to be able to share their stories and continue to be champions for immigrants and their
rights.

## Potential Impact

Development of this system will help free NILC intake workers to work on the most specialized
and difficult cases rather than having to wade through the massive amount of more easily handled
cases. In addition, in the future the system will allow automated matching (and notification) of
cases to volunteer lawyers who have pledged to offer their pro-bono services to the NILC. As stated
earlier, all case intake, volunteer matching, and story collection for comms is currently done
manually by the NILC, so being able to create a centralized and simple to use system would ease
the burden currently on NILC staffers. D4D and the NILC have been working for months on developing
the Champion System and the NILC is very eager to begin dev and use of the system, so rest assured
that work on the system will definitely go to good use.
